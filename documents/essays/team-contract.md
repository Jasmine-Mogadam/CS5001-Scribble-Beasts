Team meetings will be in-person at TUC every Tuesday at 11:30pm. If members cannot meet in person, they will meet online via Discord.

## Project Focus

We plan to complete the basic game loop of Scribble Beasts and hold 3 playtests throughout the development process. This is to ensure our product's quality.

Our game is based off a card game Jasmine Mogadam made with other students for a game design class. The rules can be found here: https://mailuc-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mogadajh_mail_uc_edu/EWRqEk-Uh_1LiBrC9XI9Vm0Bk0xxTVlN5otgOoWeTAEi8w?e=88rgVc

This project will recreate the physical gameplay in the form of a jackbox-esc party game.
