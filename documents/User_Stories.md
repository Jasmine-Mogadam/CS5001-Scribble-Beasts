As a friend, I want to play games with other friends, so I can socialize and strengthen my friendships.

As a host, I want a game that's easy to set up, so I can spend more time with my guests.

As a mobile gamer, I want the game to work with my device, so I don't feel left out.

As an artist, I want simple drawing controls in art games, so I can express myself without stress.
